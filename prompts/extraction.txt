EXTRACT THESE FIELDS:
{extract}

GENERAL EXTRACTION GUIDANCE:
- year: Publication year (YYYY format) or null
- study_design: State explicitly or infer from "retrospective/prospective/RCT"
- sample_size_patients: Primary cohort N only (ignore validation sets). Look for "N=X", "n participants", "enrolled"
- sample_size_images: Total images/scans if stated separately, otherwise null
- clinical_domain: SPECIFIC application (e.g., "Breast Cancer Detection", not just "Cancer")
- imaging_modality: ALL modalities mentioned - CT, MRI, X-ray, Ultrasound, PET, etc.
- primary_outcomes: Main measured metrics (Sensitivity, AUC, Accuracy) - NOT methods (CNN, cross-validation)
- sensitivity/specificity/auc/accuracy: Decimal format 0-1 (e.g., 0.92 not 92%), or null
- comparison_standard: What is reference? (radiologist, biopsy, gold standard, clinical follow-up) - CRITICAL for interpretation
- main_findings: 1-2 sentences of key results with metric values
- limitations: Author-stated or methodologically obvious
- clinical_implications: Stated in discussion or null
- statistical_tests: Formal tests (t-test, chi-square, logistic regression) - NOT software
- analysis_methods: Approaches (5-fold cross-validation, ROC curve, stratified analysis)
- software: Languages/frameworks (Python, R, TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
