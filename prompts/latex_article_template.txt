   INTRODUCTION:
   - Current state of research in {topic}
   - Key challenges in the field
   - Gaps in existing literature
   - Current landscape and deficiencies
   - Explicit research questions

   METHODS:
   - PubMed search strategy (exact query)
   - Date range: 2014-2024 (rationale)
   - Inclusion/exclusion criteria (explicit)
   - Screening process (two-stage)
   - Data extraction (standardized form)
   - Quality assessment (QUADAS-2 details)
   - Analysis approach (quantitative + thematic)
   - PRISMA 2020 compliance statement

   RESULTS:
   - Study selection numbers with percentages
   - Study characteristics (Table 1 reference)
   - Intervention types and distribution (related to {topic})
   - Breakdown by modality (CT, MRI, US, etc.)
   - Breakdown by clinical domain
   - Performance metrics (sensitivity, specificity, AUC) with ranges
   - Cost-effectiveness analysis where available (report on ROI, cost per case)
   - Implementation status and challenges
   - User experience findings
   - Quality assessment distribution
   - Successful implementation case studies (focus on deployed systems)

   THEMATIC SYNTHESIS:
   - Major themes identified and analyzed:
      1. Technology Evolution (shift to AI/ML)
      2. Clinical Performance (diagnostic value)
      3. Implementation Challenges (barriers)
      4. User Acceptance (human factors)
      5. Pediatric Considerations (age-specific issues)
      6. Evidence Gaps (research needs)
   - For each theme: evidence quality, frequency, clinical significance
   - Cross-cutting patterns and paradoxes

   DISCUSSION:
   - Principal findings with fresh interpretation
   - Discuss why implementation lags behind technical capabilities
   - Analyze research paradoxes (e.g., strong performance metrics vs. poor adoption)
   - Quantitative limitations (heterogeneity, bias, gaps)
   - Qualitative limitations (limited diversity, publication bias)
   - Technical barriers (EHR integration, data standardization)
   - Organizational barriers (cost, workflow, institutional factors)
   - Human factors (skepticism, trust, job concerns)
   - Healthcare system factors (regulation, liability, reimbursement)
   - Regulatory frameworks
   - Specific challenges and opportunities
   - Case studies highlighting novel implementation approaches
   - Future research priorities with original proposals
   - Clinical practice implications addressing real-world constraints
   - Comparison with related reviews while highlighting unique contributions
   - Innovative solutions for AI/ML transparency:
      * Explainable AI (XAI) techniques
      * Model documentation standards
      * Open-source implementations
      * Independent validation protocols

   CONCLUSIONS:
   - Summary of main findings
   - Clinical significance
   - Most critical research gap
   - Recommendations for high-risk-of-bias study designs:
      * Improved reporting standards
      * Prospective validation studies
      * Real-world performance monitoring
   - Specific recommendations for:
      * Clinicians/institutions
      * Researchers
      * Industry/developers
      * Policymakers (including regulatory frameworks)

3. QUALITY & STYLE:
   - Professional academic tone with moderate stylistic variation
   - Clear, concise writing that favors direct communication over filler phrases

   - Proper LaTeX escaping: use \& for &, \% for %, \$ for $, \# for #
   - Preserve LaTeX commands like \cite, \\ref, \section exactly as generated
   - Critical analysis (explain WHY findings matter)
   - Use jargon strategically - explain technical terms if needed
   - Vary sentence structure to avoid repetitive patterns
   - Use active voice where appropriate
   - Avoid passive voice when it weakens meaning
   - Try to use an unconventional style, with large rhithm variations and sentence lengths, to make the article more engaging and less formulaic
