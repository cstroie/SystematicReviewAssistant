TASK: Extract systematic review components from a research topic description.
OUTPUT: Valid JSON only (no markdown, no prose).

INPUT: {request}

REQUIRED FIELDS (must all be present):
1. query (string): PubMed search string
   - Must include 3+ MeSH terms in [MAJR] or [Title/Abstract] tags
   - Must use AND/OR/NOT operators with proper parentheses
   - Must be executable in PubMed (test format: "(term1[MAJR]) AND (term2[Title/Abstract])")
   
2. topic (string, 5-15 words): Formal, specific description of the review scope
   - Must be suitable for documentation/methods sections
   - Format: "[Population] [Intervention/Domain] [Context]"
   
3. title (string): LaTeX-formatted review title
   - Must include "Systematic Review" or "Meta-analysis"
   - Special characters escaped: \textit{}, \textbf{}, etc. as needed
   - Format: "{Main Topic}: A Systematic Review of {Methodology}"
   
4. screening (object):
   - inclusion (array, 3-5 items): Studies TO include
   - exclusion (array, 3-5 items): Studies TO exclude
   - RULE: Each criterion must be mutually exclusive with at least one exclusion criterion
   - RULE: Criteria must address: study design, population, intervention, outcomes
   - RULE: Each criterion is 1 sentence, specific and measurable
   
5. quality (string): SINGLE value from enum
   - Valid values: "GRADE" | "ROBINS-I" | "RE-AIM" | "QUADAS-2" | "QUADAS-AI"
   - Selection rule: Choose based on primary study types expected
     * GRADE: RCTs/meta-analyses of interventions
     * ROBINS-I: Observational with control groups
     * RE-AIM: Implementation/feasibility studies
     * QUADAS-2: Diagnostic accuracy studies
     * QUADAS-AI: AI/ML validation studies
   
6. extract (object): 1-3 key data fields
   - Field naming: snake_case, max 20 chars
   - Value: (string) Description of expected data type/values (1-2 sentences)
   - Fields must directly answer the implicit research questions
   - Field names must be extractable from full-text articles (avoid broad concepts)
   
7. analysis (array of strings, 2-4 items): Analysis plan bullet points
   - Must reference AT LEAST 2 fields from "extract"
   - Format: "Distribution/Trends/Comparison by `fieldname` [and other_field]"
   - No markdown backticks in output JSON values (use field names directly)
   - Each describes a specific synthesis approach

QUALITY CHECKS:
- JSON must be valid and parseable
- Arrays cannot be empty
- No null or undefined values
- String values stripped of leading/trailing whitespace
- Query must contain at least 2 boolean operators
