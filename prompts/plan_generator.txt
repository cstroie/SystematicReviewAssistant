Generate a systematic literature review components based on this research topic description:
"{plan}"

Return JSON with these keys:
1. "query" - a properly formatted PubMed search query using MeSH terms and keywords
2. "topic" - a short formal topic description for documentation
3. "title" - a LaTeX-formatted title for the review article
4. "screening" - contains two sub-keys:
   - "inclusion" - list of 3-5 criteria for including articles
   - "exclusion" - list of 3-5 criteria for excluding articles
5. "quality" - select the most appropriate quality assessment tool from: GRADE, ROBINS-I, RE-AIM, QUADAS-2, QUADAS-AI
6. "extract" - dictionary of 1-3 field names and descriptions for key topic-specific data to extract.
                Choose field names that capture essential characteristics of interventions/outcomes.
                Fields should be specific, well-defined, and directly relevant to answering
                the review's research questions.
7. "analysis" - Markdown-formatted bullet points for the later text synthesis section using the fields from "extract".
                Example: "analysis": ["Distribution by `field1`", "Trends in `field2` over time", "Clinical impact of `field3`"]

Tool selection guidance:
- GRADE: For overall evidence quality of randomized trials
- ROBINS-I: Observational interventions with control/comparison groups
- RE-AIM: Implementation feasibility studies
- QUADAS-2: Diagnostic/precision medicine accuracy studies
- QUADAS-AI: AI/ML algorithm validation studies

First deeply understand the research topic and domain to create meaningful criteria that address:
- Study designs/methodology
- Population/interventions
- Outcomes/measurements
- Clinical applications
- Technical implementations

Criteria should be:
- Specific and measurable
- Mutually exclusive between inclusion/exclusion
- Relevant to the review's research questions
- Free from implementation bias

Follow these guidelines for the query:
- Include MeSH terms and keywords
- Use appropriate field tags like [Title/Abstract], [MAJR], etc
- Apply proper boolean operators
- Include publication date filters when appropriate
- Use parentheses for proper operator precedence

For the title:
- Use LaTeX formatting for any special characters or capitalization
- Include the main topic and methodology ("systematic review" or "meta-analysis")

Example valid JSON response:
{{
  "query": "(clinical decision support system[Title/Abstract]) AND (medical imaging[MAJR] OR radiology[MAJR]) AND (\"artificial intelligence\"[Title/Abstract] OR \"machine learning\"[Title/Abstract])",
  "topic": "Clinical Decision Support Systems in Medical Imaging/Radiology",
  "title": "A Systematic Review of Clinical Decision Support Systems in Medical Imaging",
  "screening": {{
    "inclusion": [
      "Primary research studies evaluating clinical decision support systems",
      "Applied to medical imaging interpretation (radiology, CT, MRI, etc)",
      "Reports diagnostic accuracy metrics (sensitivity, specificity)",
      "Includes human clinical validation"
    ],
    "exclusion": [
      "Studies focused only on imaging physics/reconstruction",
      "Non-clinical applications (e.g., industrial imaging)",
      "Literature reviews without primary data",
      "Animal or phantom studies only"
    ]
  }},
  "extract": {{
    "cdss_type": "AI/ML-based|Rule-based|Hybrid|Statistical",
    "integration_level": "PACS/RIS integration level (none/basic/full)"
  }},
  "analysis": [
      "Distribution by CDSS type",
      "Integration level trends",
      "Clinical impact of integration level"
  ]
}}
