Assess risk of bias using ROBINS-I for non-randomized intervention studies.

PMID: {pmid}
TITLE: {title}
ABSTRACT: {abstract}

Evaluate these ROBINS-I domains (answer: Low|Moderate|Serious|Critical|No Information):

1. CONFOUNDING (pre-intervention variables affecting both intervention and outcome)
2. SELECTION (systematic differences in participant inclusion/exclusion)
3. INTERVENTION CLASSIFICATION (accurate distinction between intervention groups)
4. DEVIATIONS FROM INTENDED INTERVENTIONS (protocol violations during implementation)
5. MISSING DATA (completeness and handling of missing data)
6. OUTCOME MEASUREMENT (validity and reliability of outcome assessment)
7. SELECTIVE REPORTING (bias in selection of reported results)
