You are writing a thematic synthesis section for a systematic review on 
"{topic}".

We have analyzed {total_studies} studies. Here's a sample of the extracted data:

{data_sample}

Based on this analysis and typical patterns in this field, provide a comprehensive synthesis with these sections:

1. STUDY CHARACTERISTICS
   - Range of years, study designs, sample sizes
   - Imaging modalities covered
   - Clinical domains studied

2. TYPES OF CDSS SYSTEMS
   - Distribution by type (AI/ML vs rule-based)
   - Technology trends over time

3. CLINICAL PERFORMANCE
   - Range of reported metrics (sensitivity, specificity, AUC)
   - Best and worst performing systems
   - Performance by clinical domain

4. THEMATIC ANALYSIS
   - Common themes across studies
   - Key findings and consistencies
   - Important variations and contradictions

5. METHODOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
   - Common strengths
   - Prevalent limitations
   - Quality trends

6. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
   - Evidence for clinical implementation
   - Adoption barriers
   - Impact on clinical workflows

7. RESEARCH GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Underrepresented clinical domains
   - Methodological gaps
   - Recommendations for future research

Write in clear, structured prose suitable for a systematic review report. Use concrete examples 
from the studies where possible.
