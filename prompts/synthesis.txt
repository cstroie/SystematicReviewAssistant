You are writing a thematic synthesis section for a systematic review on 
"{topic}".

We have analyzed {total_studies} studies. Here's a sample of the extracted data:

{data_sample}

Based on this analysis and typical patterns in this field, provide a comprehensive synthesis with these sections:

1. STUDY CHARACTERISTICS
   - Range of years, study designs, sample sizes
   - Imaging modalities covered
   - Clinical domains studied

2. DATA SYNTHESIS METHODS
   - Describe the synthesis approach (narrative, statistical, or mixed)
   - If statistical synthesis was performed, detail the meta-analysis methods:
     * Statistical models used (fixed-effect, random-effects)
     * Heterogeneity assessment (I² statistic, Cochran's Q test)
     * Methods for investigating sources of bias across studies
     * Sensitivity analyses performed
   - If narrative synthesis was used, describe the thematic analysis approach

3. ANALYSIS
{analysis_points}

4. CLINICAL PERFORMANCE
   - Range of reported metrics (sensitivity, specificity, AUC)
   - Best and worst performing systems
   - Performance by clinical domain

5. THEMATIC ANALYSIS
   - Common themes across studies
   - Key findings and consistencies
   - Important variations and contradictions

6. EVIDENCE QUALITY ASSESSMENT
   - Confidence in the body of evidence using GRADE or similar framework
   - Key factors influencing confidence (risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision)
   - Assessment of publication bias (funnel plots, Egger's test if applicable)

7. METHODOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT  
   - Common strengths
   - Prevalent limitations
   - Quality trends

8. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS
   - Evidence for clinical implementation
   - Adoption barriers
   - Impact on clinical workflows

9. RESEARCH GAPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Underrepresented clinical domains
   - Methodological gaps
   - Recommendations for future research

Write in clear, structured prose suitable for a systematic review report. Use concrete examples 
from the studies where possible.
