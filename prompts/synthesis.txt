You are writing a comprehensive thematic synthesis section for a systematic review on:
"{topic}"

CONTEXT:
- Total studies analyzed: {total_studies}
- Quality assessment tool: {quality_tool}
- Analysis plan: {analysis_points}

DATA SAMPLE (representative subset):
{data_sample}

CRITICAL PRINCIPLES FOR SYNTHESIS:
1. Ground all statements in the provided data sample. Do NOT invent findings or patterns not evident in the data.
2. Distinguish between:
   - What is REPORTED in studies (e.g., "X% of studies reported Y")
   - What you INFER from patterns (e.g., "Studies with larger samples tended to report...")
   - What is HYPOTHESIZED for explanation (e.g., "This discrepancy may be due to...")
3. For conflicting findings, explain the conflict rather than ignoring it.
4. Use precise language: "Most" = 70%+, "Many" = 50-70%, "Some" = 25-50%, "Few" = <25%
5. When meta-analysis is possible but heterogeneity is high (I² >75%), discuss both pooled estimate AND reasons for heterogeneity.

WRITE THESE SECTIONS:

1. STUDY CHARACTERISTICS
   Describe the sample:
   - Temporal range (earliest to latest publication year)
   - Study designs included (counts: N RCTs, N retrospective, etc.)
   - Sample size range (min-max total patients, min-max total images if applicable)
   - Imaging modalities (list all, note if dominated by one type)
   - Clinical domains (list applications covered, note any gaps or concentration)
   - Geographic/institutional spread if relevant

2. DATA SYNTHESIS APPROACH
   Explain your synthesis decision logic:
   - Is meta-analysis appropriate? (Check: Are metrics comparable? Is heterogeneity manageable?)
     * If YES → Describe statistical synthesis method (fixed/random effects, heterogeneity testing)
     * If NO → Explain why (e.g., "Heterogeneous outcomes, study designs, or metric reporting")
   - For quantitative synthesis: Report I², Cochran's Q, methods for addressing heterogeneity
   - For narrative synthesis: Describe thematic grouping approach
   - If mixed: Explain which analyses are statistical vs. narrative

3. ANALYSIS SYNTHESIS
   Using the analysis plan points:
   {analysis_points}
   
   For each analysis point:
   - Synthesize findings across studies
   - Quantify patterns where possible ("X of Y studies found...")
   - Highlight convergence and divergence
   - Explain contradictions (methodological differences? study quality? real heterogeneity?)

4. PERFORMANCE METRICS
   Present reported outcomes systematically:
   - Sensitivity: range (min-max), median, distribution across studies
   - Specificity: range (min-max), median, distribution across studies
   - AUC (if reported): range, median, number of studies reporting
   - Accuracy: range, median, any patterns by study type/domain
   
   Stratification (if data permits):
   - Performance by clinical domain
   - Performance by imaging modality
   - Performance trends by publication year (if evident)
   
   Interpretation:
   - Best performing systems (cite studies, describe characteristics)
   - Worst performing systems (cite studies, explain limitations)
   - Are high performers using similar methods? Do they share quality features?

5. THEMATIC FINDINGS
   Synthesize key themes:
   - What are the main conclusions across studies?
   - Are findings consistent? If not, why? (Study quality? Methodology? Real heterogeneity?)
   - Key implications from converging evidence
   - Important caveats from divergent findings
   - Unexpected or counterintuitive findings

6. EVIDENCE QUALITY & CONFIDENCE
   Using {quality_tool} framework:
   - Overall confidence rating (High/Moderate/Low/Very Low)
   - For each quality domain, explain factors:
     * Risk of bias: Common issues across studies? Any low-bias studies?
     * Inconsistency: I² values? Do results point same direction?
     * Indirectness: Are study populations/interventions close to clinical question?
     * Imprecision: Are confidence intervals wide? Sample sizes adequate?
     * Publication bias: {publication_bias_guidance}
   
   Publication Bias Assessment:
   {publication_bias_conditional}

7. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY TRENDS
   - Common strengths (what do well-conducted studies do?)
   - Prevalent limitations (what issues appear across studies?)
   - Quality trends over time (improving? static?)
   - Any quality patterns by domain or modality?

8. CLINICAL APPLICABILITY
   - Current evidence for clinical implementation (what does body of evidence support?)
   - Implementation barriers (cost, technical requirements, workflow integration?)
   - Evidence gaps for clinical deployment (what would change practice?)
   - Relevant context from lower-confidence evidence (pilot studies, feasibility work)

9. RESEARCH GAPS & FUTURE DIRECTIONS
   - Clinical domains underrepresented (which applications have few studies?)
   - Methodological gaps (standardization issues? study design gaps?)
   - Emerging approaches (new methods, modalities, applications?)
   - Recommendations for future research based on identified gaps

PRESENTATION:
- Write in clear prose suitable for peer-reviewed publication
- Use concrete examples: cite PMIDs, specific findings from studies
- Quantify patterns: "X of Y studies (Z%)" rather than vague language
- Explain contradictions rather than averaging them away
- Connect synthesis to your analysis plan - don't treat it as separate
